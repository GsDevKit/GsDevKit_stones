alphaMixed: proportion with: aColor 
	"Answer this color mixed with the given color. The proportion, a number 
	between 0.0 and 1.0, determines what what fraction of the receiver to  
	use in the mix. For example, 0.9 would yield a color close to the  
	receiver. This method uses RGB interpolation; HSV interpolation can lead 
	to surprises.  Mixes the alphas (for transparency) also."
